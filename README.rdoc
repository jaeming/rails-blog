== A simple Rails blog

The foundation for this blog is based on the Getting Started tutorial from the official Rails guides: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

I have styled and customized it to my own tastes using the Zurb Foundation as my framework of choice. Haml is implemented instead of .erb
